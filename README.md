# Palindrome Checker
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. level, refer. In this project, I developed a project that checks whether the data entered by the user has a palindrome structure. You can click [here](https://yasinakbulut.com/projects/palindrome-checker/) test the project live and you can try palindrome words.
